<h3>About</h3>

<p><strong>TL; DR:</strong> the cutting plane game had a MAJOR update and is now hosted <a href="https://bigkwii.github.io/cutting-plane-game-2-web-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>If you are feeling nostalgic, you can check the first prototype <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~gm2543/cpgame.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>In June 2025, the cutting plane game had a major improvement from the original prototype. This is the first stable version, completely developed by √Ålvaro "big_kwii" Morales, an excellent former Computer Science student at Universidad de Chile I had the pleasure to advise. 
<p>Some important changes with respect to the original version are:</p>
<ul>
<li>All levels <span style="color: #ff0000;">can be completed</span> with the given cut budgets.</li>
<li>A tutorial mode is now implemented, which teaches the player the game mechanics.</li>
<li>A level editor was added, where you can <span style="color: #ff0000;">create and play</span> with your favorite polytope.</li>
<li>Other new modes include <span style="color: #ff0000;">speedrun</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">free play</span>.</li>
<li>The game is now developed in Godot, a free, open-source game engine.</li>
<li>The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/bigkwii/cutting-plane-game-2">HERE</a></li>
<li>Plus many design changes and improvements to improve playability</li>
</ul>
<p>All feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
